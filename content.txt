Set up a local web server. You can do this in several ways:

If you have Python installed, you can run python -m http.server in the directory containing your files.
If you have Node.js installed, you can use a package like http-server.
You can also use apps like MAMP or XAMPP to set up a local server.


Open a web browser and navigate to the local server address (usually http://localhost:8000 or similar, depending on your setup).
Click the "Load Content" button to fetch and display the content from "content.txt".

Key features of this website:

It uses the Fetch API to read the content of a text file.
The content is displayed when the user clicks a button, allowing for user-initiated actions.
Error handling is implemented to display a message if the file can't be loaded.

Remember, due to security restrictions, this won't work if you simply open the HTML file directly in a browser. It needs to be served from a web server, even if it's a local one.
To further enhance this website, you could:

Add the ability to load different text files.
Implement a feature to edit the content directly on the webpage.
Add formatting options for the loaded text.
